# Ansible NGINX Configuration Role

This role configures NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus on your target host.

**Note:** This role is still in active development. There may be unidentified issues and the role variables may change as development continues.

## Requirements

### Ansible

- This role is developed and tested with [maintained](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html) versions of Ansible core (above `2.16`).
- When using Ansible core, you will also need to install the following collections:

    ```yaml
    ---
    collections:
      - name: ansible.posix
        version: 1.5.4
      - name: community.general
        version: 7.1.0
      - name: community.docker # Only required if you plan to use Molecule (see below)
        version: 3.4.7
    ```

    **Note:** You can alternatively install the Ansible community distribution (what is known as the "old" Ansible) if you don't want to manage individual collections.
- Instructions on how to install Ansible can be found in the [Ansible website](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#upgrading-ansible-from-version-2-9-and-older-to-version-2-10-or-later).

### Jinja2

- This role uses Jinja2 templates. Ansible core installs Jinja2 by default, but depending on your install and/or upgrade path, you might be running an outdated version of Jinja2. The minimum version of Jinja2 required for the role to properly function is `3.1`.
- Instructions on how to install Jinja2 can be found in the [Jinja2 website](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/intro/#installation).

### Molecule (Optional)

- Molecule is used to test the various functionalities of the role. The recommended version of Molecule to test this role is `4.x`.
- Instructions on how to install Molecule can be found in the [Molecule website](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). *You will also need to install the Molecule Docker driver.*
- To run the NGINX Plus/App Protect config Molecule tests, you must copy your NGINX Plus/App Protect license to the role's [`files/license`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config/blob/main/files/license/) directory.

  You can alternatively add your NGINX Plus/App Protect repository certificate and key to the local environment. Run the following commands to export these files as base64-encoded variables and execute the Molecule tests:

  ```bash
  export NGINX_CRT=$( cat <path to your certificate file> | base64 )
  export NGINX_KEY=$( cat <path to your key file> | base64 )
  molecule test -s plus
  ```

## Installation

This role can be installed via either Ansible Galaxy (the Ansible community marketplace) or by cloning this repo. Once installed, you will need to include the role it in your Ansible playbook using [the `roles` keyword, the `import_role` module, or the `include_role` module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#using-roles).

### Ansible Galaxy

To install the latest stable release of the role on your system, use:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install nginxinc.nginx_config
```

Alternatively, if you have already installed the role, you can update the role to the latest release by using:

```bash
ansible-galaxy install -f nginxinc.nginx_config
```

To use the role, include the following task in your playbook:

```yaml
- name: Configure NGINX
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: nginxinc.nginx_config
```

### Git

To pull the latest edge commit of the role from GitHub, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config.git
```

To use the role, include the following task in your playbook:

```yaml
- name: Configure NGINX
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: <path/to/repo> # e.g. <roles/ansible-role-nginx-config> if you clone the repo inside your project's roles directory
```

## Platforms

The NGINX config Ansible role supports all platforms supported by [NGINX Open Source](https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#mainline) and [NGINX Plus](https://www.nginx.com/products/technical-specs/).

***Note:** You should be able to use this role to configure any NGINX installation -- wherever/however it's been installed -- at your own risk. Any potential bugs with the role involving unsupported installation methods/platforms will be addressed in a best effort manner and might be outright dismissed.*

## Role Variables

This role has multiple variables. The descriptions and defaults for all these variables can be found in the **[`defaults/main/`](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx-config/blob/main/defaults/main/)** directory in the following files:
