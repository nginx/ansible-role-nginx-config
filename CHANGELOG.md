# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (Unreleased)

BREAKING CHANGES:

*   The default port of the status module is now 8080 and matches the CI molecule test which already used it. Set ```nginx_config_status_port```to another desired value.

ENHANCEMENTS:

*   Add survey to README.
*   Improve README structure and use tables where relevant.
*   Update Ansible (now Ansible base) to `2.10.2`, Ansible (now Ansible Community Distribution) to `2.10.0`, and yamllint to `1.25.0`.

BUG FIXES:

*   Prevent TravisCI from trying to build (and failing) NGINX Plus images on external PRs.
*   Fix naming for SELinux Ansible facts.
*   Correctly import `app_protect` global directives in template.
*   Role now runs correctly when using Ansible's check mode.

## 0.2.0 (September 24, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:

*   The process to configure modules has changed. Instead of manually setting the modules you want to install to `true` or `false`, you will now have to use either:
    *   A newly introduced top level list variable, `nginx_config_modules`.
    *   A newly introduced list variable within your main NGINX config template, `nginx_config_main_template.modules`.

Make sure you only use one variable or the other, since they will overwrite each other. This change will simplify adding future supported modules to this role, and allows you to include any external modules you may wish in your NGINX config.

FEATURES:

*   Support for all NGINX App Protect directives has been added. You can find details on the supported directives on `defaults/main/template.yml`. This is the first module to be included using J2 macros. Expect to slowly see a refactor of various modules to use macros where possible.
*   Add Alpine `3.12` to the list of supported platforms.
*   Remove Alpine `3.8` from the list of supported platforms .
*   Add NGINX Plus tests to TravisCI

ENHANCEMENTS:

*   Added handlers to check for NGINX syntax validity and fail if any errors are detected.
*   Switch to using `ansible_facts` wherever possible.
*   Improved tasks naming conventions.
*   Update Ansible to `2.9.13` and Ansible Lint to `4.3.5`.
*   Explicitly defined `mode` in relevant tasks.
*   Improve configuration templating capabilities:
    *   Allow setting `access_log`/`access_log_location` to `off`.
    *   Add IP restriction for web servers

BUG FIXES:

*   An empty `nginx_config_cleanup_files` will no longer cause `nginx_config_cleanup` related tasks to fail.
